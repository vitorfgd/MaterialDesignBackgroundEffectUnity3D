Material Design Background Effect - Unity3D
===================

Google material design/ flat design background effect I created for Unity3D, really simple but very useful. You can simply call the function "ChangeBackground ()" from BackgroundController.cs and the magic will be done.

How to use?
-------------
* Add **"Assets/Scripts/BackgroundController.cs"** to a game object;
* Add background prefabs. You can find some in **"Assets/Prefabs"** or create your own.
* This script will automatically call **"ChangeBackground ()"** on game start, if you'd like to change the background during runtime, find the script and call the function whenever you'd like (i.e.: menu transitions, scene transitions, etc.)
* (Optional) To add this scripts and prefabs to an existing project, simply import "unitypackages/materialdesign.unitypackage".
